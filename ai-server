The Kubernetes API is the front end of the Kubernetes control plane and is how users interact with their Kubernetes cluster. 
The API (application programming interface) server determines if a request is valid and then processes it.

In essence, the API is the interface used to manage, create, and configure Kubernetes clusters. It's how the users, external components, and parts of your cluster all communicate
with each other.

At the center of the Kubernetes control plane is the API server and the HTTP API that it exposes, allowing you to query and manipulate the state of Kubernetes objects.
