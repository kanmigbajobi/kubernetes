Replication Controller is one of the key features of Kubernetes, which is responsible for managing the pod lifecycle.
It is responsible for making sure that the specified number of pod replicas are running at any point of time. 
It is used in time when one wants to make sure that the specified number of pod or at least one pod is running. 
It has the capability to bring up or down the specified no of pod.
It is a best practice to use the replication controller to manage the pod life cycle rather than creating a pod again and again.
