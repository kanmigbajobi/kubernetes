Kubeadm defaults to running a single member etcd cluster in a static pod managed by the kubelet on the control plane node. This is not a high availability setup as the etcd cluster 
contains only one member and cannot sustain any members becoming unavailable.
As the primary datastore of Kubernetes, etcd stores and replicates all Kubernetes cluster states. Since it is a critical component of a Kubernetes cluster it is important that etcd has a reliable approach to its configuration and management.

Because etcd is a distributed consensus-based system, the cluster configuration of etcd can be complicated. Bootstrapping, maintaining quorum, reconfiguring cluster membership, 
creating backups, handling disaster recovery, and monitoring critical events are complex and tedious tasks requiring specialized expertise.

All of this is made easier through use of the etcd Operator.
For durability and high availability, run etcd as a multi-node cluster in production and back it up periodically. A five-member cluster is recommended in production.
